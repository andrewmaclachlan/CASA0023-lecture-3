# This lecture and practical are solely about getting started with the two data science tools we will use `r emo::ji("book")`

# 1. Xaringan for group presentations*

# 2. Bookdown for individual portofios 

###* there will also be a short group contributions form to complete 

---

# How to use the lectures

- Slides are made with [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1)

- `r fa("search")` In the bottom left there is a search tool which will search all content of presentation

- Control + F will also search 

- Press enter to move to the next result 

- `r fa("pencil-alt")` In the top right let's you draw on the slides, although these aren't saved.

- Pressing the letter `o` (for overview) will allow you to see an overview of the whole presentation and go to a slide

- Alternatively just typing the slide number e.g. 10 on the website will take you to that slide

- Pressing alt+F will fit the slide to the screen, this is useful if you have resized the window and have another open - side by side.

# Geometric correction

We have seen in GIS that a satellite image is given a coordinate reference system.

But when remotely sensed data is collected image distortions can be introduced due to:

* View angle (off-nadir)* - [Nadir means directly down](https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/19727/in-spacecraft-talk-is-nadir-just-a-fancy-word-for-down)
* Topography (e.g. hills not flat ground)
* Wind (if from a plane)
* Rotation of the earth (from satellite)

# Geometric correction solution

* We identify Ground Control Points (GPS) to match known points in the image and a reference dataset
  * local map 
  * another image
  * GPS data from handheld device 
  
.pull-left[

* We take the coordinates and model them to give geometric transformation coefficients 
* Think back to GIS - linear regression with our distorted x or y as the dependent

* We then plot these and try to minimise the RMSE - Jensen sets a RMSE value of 0.5
]


.pull-right[

* There are [many transformation algorithms available](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/153227/transformation-types-in-geo-referencing-of-qgis) to model the actual coordinates

* This is the same process if you have ever seen an old map sheet overlaid to in a GIS.

# Geometric correction solution 2...

RMSE
  * (observed - predicted (the residual))^2
  * sum them and divide by number of data points
  * square root that total
  
* [The model with the lowest RMSE will fit best](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/8900/generally-accepted-root-mean-square-rms-error-for-rectifying-topographic-maps) ...   

When we do this we also might shift the data slightly ...so we must re-sample the final raster:

  * Cubic spline

# Atmospheric correction  

According to Jensen the two most important sources of environmental attenuation are:

* Atmospheric scattering (as we saw in week 1)
* Topographic attenuation (up next)

Jensen goes on to discuss necessary and unnecessary atmospheric correction:

.pull-left[
**Unnecessary**

* Classification of a single image 
* Independent classification of multi date imagery 
* Composite images (combining images)
* Single dates or where training data extracted from all data
]

.pull-right[
**Necessary**
* Biophysical parameters needed (e.g. temperature, leaf area index, NDVI)
* E.g. .. .NDVI is used in the Africa Famine Early Warning System and Livestock Early Warning System
* Using spectral signatures through time and space

# Atmospheric correction types

### Relative 


* Normalize intensities of different bands within a single image
* Normalise intensities of bands from many dates to one date

.pull-left[ 
* Dark object subtraction (DOS) or histogram adjustment 
  * Searches each band for the darkest value then subtracts that from each pixel 
  * Landsat bands 1-3 (visible) have increased scattering vs longer wavelengths
]

.pull-right[ 

* Psuedo-invariant Features (PIFs)  
  * Assume brightness pixels linearly related to a base image...
  * Regression per band $y=1.025x+21.152$
  * Adjust the image based on the regression result. 
  * Here y is the value of our base. To get y we multiply our new date pixel (x) by the coefficient and add the intercept value.
  * Apply this to the rest of the pixels..
